# ELECTRA

The ELECTRA model was proposed in the paper [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB). ELECTRA introduces a new pretraining approach, in which two transformers models are trained: the generator and the discriminator. The generator is trained as a masked language model (MLM), where a number of tokens in an input sequence are corrupted, and the generator is tasked with reconstructing the original sequence. The discriminator on the other hand, is tasked with identifying which tokens were replaced by the generator in the sequence. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in terms of compute, since the discriminator has to identify which tokens are replaced by the generator over the entire sequence, rather than a small subset of tokens as in traditional MLM.

## Weights

* [**`electra-small-discriminator-da-256-cased`**](https://huggingface.co/sarnikowski/electra-small-discriminator-da-256-cased): 12-layer, 256-hidden, 4-heads

## Usage

Here is an example on how to load the model in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) using the [ðŸ¤—Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForPreTraining

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sarnikowski/electra-small-discriminator-da-256-cased")
model = AutoModelForPreTraining.from_pretrained("sarnikowski/electra-small-discriminator-da-256-cased")
```

## Benchmarks

All downstream task benchmarks are evaluated on **finetuned** versions of the transformer models.
The dataset used for benchmarking both NER and POS tagging is the Danish Dependency Treebank [UD-DDT](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Danish-DDT). 
All models were trained for 3 epochs on the train set with the same seed and learning rate.

#### Named entity recognition

The table below shows the F1 score on the test+dev set on the entities `LOC`, `ORG`, `PER` and `MISC`. Notice that `AVG` refers to the weighted average.

## Data

The danish corpora used for pretraining was created from the following sources:

* [Oscar](https://oscar-corpus.com/) ~9.5gb
* [Leipzig danish corpora](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download) ~1.5gb
* [Wikipedia Monolingual Corpora](https://linguatools.org/tools/corpora/wikipedia-monolingual-corpora/) ~1.5gb
* [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) ~3gb
* [DaNewsroom](https://github.com/danielvarab/da-newsroom) ~2gb

All characters in the corpus were transliterated to ASCII with the exception of `Ã¦Ã¸Ã¥Ã†Ã˜Ã…Â§`.
Sources containing web crawled data, were cleaned of overrepresented "dirty" ads and commercials.
The final dataset consists of `14,483,456` precomputed tensors of length 256.
